==============================
This is a now abandoned plugin that was going to be added to SpeedSentry to
allow SpeedSentry to monitor customer site CPU, memory, and free disk space.

At the point that Inesonic decided to discontinue SpeedSentry, this plugin was
mostly functional with only a few minor known bugs remaining.

The plugin relies on changes that are already in place in the DbC as well as
changes that were made to the SpeedSentry website backend.
